## Usage: 
Git lignore "filename"
## Installation:
Clone repo, chmod +x git-lignore, cp git-lignore /usr/local/bin, restart bash/zsh.
## How it works: 
Creates a symbol link to your .git/info/exclude file in your repo that ignores both itself and any files you wish to add to it. Add more files with further git lignore or just vi .local_gitignore.

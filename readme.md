## Usage: 
git lignore "filename"\
## Installation:
clone repo, chmod +x git-lignore, mv git-lignore /usr/local/bin, restart bash/zsh.\
## How it works: 
creates a symbol link to your .git/info/exclude file in your repo that ignores both itself and any files you wish to add to it. Add more files with further git lignore or just vi .local_gitignore.
